## About FastAPI

[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.8+ based on standard Python type hints.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1. Run the template to clone this repository and build and deploy the FastAPI app
2. Navigate to your new combined service in the FastAPI project. When the build has completed, and the container has been deployed successfully, you can access the service using the Northflank-generated `code.run` domain.
3. The service should return a JSON-response welcoming you to your FastAPI server. Add `/docs` to the domain to see the OpenAPI docs for the demo schema.
4. Make changes to the FastAPI code in your repository, and push the changes for Northflank to automatically build and deploy your updates!
